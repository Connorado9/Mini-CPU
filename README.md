# MiniCPU
Average computers today are capable of executing billions of operations every second. The speed with which these processes are completed is becoming more and more important with societyâ€™s ever-expanding need for quick computation. Thus, it is important to first analyze how these operations work at a primitive level in search of faster procedures before materializing at a larger scale. This project aims to create a miniature central processing unit (CPU) that can perform basic arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.
